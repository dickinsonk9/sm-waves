# Information 
This plugin was designed for an employer. Used for projects within company and private usage (as this is created by me, with the addition of another plugin, called [Genesis Custom Blocks](https://wordpress.org/plugins/genesis-custom-blocks/) ). 

In order to use this plugin _Custom Waves_, you will need to have the Genesis Custom Blocks installed within your theme. You may find the [github](https://github.com/studiopress/genesis-custom-blocks) and the [developer docs](https://developer.wpengine.com/genesis-custom-blocks/) in their respective places. 

## Instructions for Installation
    1. Download the .zip file from this repository.
    2. Upload to WordPress, via the Plugin screen from your website.
    3. In your theme (preferably a genesis theme), create a folder named blocks.
    4. Move the block-custom-waves.php into the blocks folder within your theme.

###Recommendations on how to use this plugin to add into the editor: 
    1. Group Block
        *Change the alignment to Full Width.
    2. Waves Cover Block
        *Select the divider style and color.
